# Assignment 3

## Description
The assignment involves implementing multiple Java programs to solve various problems related to arrays and strings.

## Output
The programs produce various outputs based on the problem they solve:

1. `ArrayUtils`:
    - `shiftArrayCyclic`: Shifts the elements of an array cyclically based on the given direction and number of moves.
    - `findShortestPath`: Finds the shortest path in a directed graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
2. `StringUtils`:
    - `findSortedSequence`: Finds the longest subsequence of words in a string that are sorted lexicographically.
    - `isEditDistanceOne`: Checks if two strings are one edit distance apart.
