Section A:

push(object o):
	doesn't maintain the invariant.
	o can be a null object, and then the top() will return null.
	solution:
		add @pre o != null

pop():
	the implementation match the contract and maintain the invariant.

top():
	the @return is not exact.
	it's true that != null will be returned,
	but the more accurate return will be:
		@return last object that was added to the list.

isEmpty():
	the @return is incorrect.
	if the list is empty the function will return true.
	solution:
		change @post @return == true iff elements.size() == 0.
