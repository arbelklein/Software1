# Assignment 7

## Description
The assignment involves implementing various greedy algorithms to solve different problems, including coin change, fractional knapsack, and minimum spanning tree.

## Output
The programs produce various outputs based on the tasks they perform:
1. Coin Change Problem:
    - Finds the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 10.
2. Fractional Knapsack Problem:
    - Determines the maximum value that can be obtained by filling a knapsack with fractional parts of items based on their value-to-weight ratio.
3. Minimum Spanning Tree:
    - Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted, undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm.
